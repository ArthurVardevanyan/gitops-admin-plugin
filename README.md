This is a WIP refactor/rewrite for OpenShift 4.15. There have been a number of new
extension points and changes to the dynamic SDK that should be incorporated into
the plugin.

Note some ActionDropDown stuff taken from kubevirt console plugin [here](https://github.com/kubevirt-ui/kubevirt-plugin/blob/main/src/utils/components/ActionsDropdown/ActionsDropdown.tsx).
